# ISIT420CourseProject

This project uses 2 data files from Human Development Index(HDI) and Fragile States Index(FSI). The data in the files are manupulated with Pig Latin using Apache Pig. 
The data is then imported in SQL database and it is used to model this ASP.NET Core Web Application. 

Here's more about the datasources:

The human development data are sourced from international data agencies with the mandate, resources, and expertise to collect national data on specific 
indicators unless otherwise noted.
It presents HDI values and ranks, data visualizations/trends for the HDI and other composite indices, country explanatory notes, and over 150 other indicators.
Datasets include definitions of indicators and sources for original data components at the end of each table, with full source details in the Statistical references.

The Fragile States Index is based on a conflict assessment framework – known as “CAST” – that was developed by FFP nearly a quarter-century ago for assessing the 
vulnerability of states to collapse. 
The CAST framework was originally designed to measure this vulnerability and assess how it might affect projects in the field, and continues to be used widely by 
policy makers, field practitioners, 
and local community networks. The methodology uses both qualitative and quantitative indicators, relies on public source data, and produces quantifiable results.
Twelve conflict risk indicators are used to measure the condition of a state at any given moment. 
The indicators provide a snapshot in time that can be measured against other snapshots in a time series to determine whether conditions are improving or worsening.
